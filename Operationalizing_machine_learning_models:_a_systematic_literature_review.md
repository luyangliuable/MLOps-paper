## Abstract/Introduction Summary:
The paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) on the state of the art and challenges of operationalizing machine learning models. It focuses on understanding the tools, infrastructure, and challenges in the MLOps domain. The review captures the essence of how ML models are operationalized with respect to tools and infrastructure, an overview of the tools reportedly used, and areas for further research.

## Motivation:
- The growing demand and realization of the importance of deploying machine learning models into real-world applications.
- A need to understand the state of the art in operationalizing these models.
- The necessity to collate and comprehend challenges and gaps in current practices, in order to further research and refine the methods.

## Benefits:
- Provides a comprehensive overview of tools and techniques for ML operationalization.
- Highlights current challenges and gaps, paving the way for focused research in those areas.
- Serves as a reference for practitioners to understand various techniques and patterns for operationalizing ML.

## Metrics:
- This paper doesn't specifically mention metrics in the provided information, so this needs to be filled in based on more specific details from the paper.

## Approaches:
- Techniques for packaging and integration.
- Methods for deployment, serving, and monitoring of ML models.
- Insights into tool usage in various stages and contexts of operationalization.

## Challenges:
- Performance and scalability challenges in prediction serving.
- Difficulties associated with model-switching.
- Challenges with edge deployment, especially with devices that may not support containerization.
- Monitoring ML models in real-time, especially in edge devices.

## How to implement responsible AI methods:
- Continuous monitoring and validation of AI systems post deployment.
- Establishing key performance indicators of the project for validation.
- Making the systems transparent and understandable to non-experts.
  
(Note: This section was inferred based on the given information. The paper might have more specific methods which should be added.)

## Reviewer's Comments:
- The paper provides an invaluable resource for both practitioners and researchers in the MLOps domain.
- The paper might benefit from incorporating more practitioner insights.
- A future direction could be to dive deeper into specific challenges like edge deployment and provide more detailed solutions.
