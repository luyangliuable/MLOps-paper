## Abstract/Introduction Summary:
The paper presents an initial investigation into MLOps practices on GitHub. The research examines the frequency and patterns of MLOps by analyzing GitHub Actions and CML. The findings reveal a noticeable lack of open-source ML projects using GitHub Actions for MLOps, but a prevalence of ML libraries or frameworks that use GitHub Actions.

## Motivation:
- Investigate the prevalence and practices of MLOps in GitHub projects.
- Examine the extent to which open-source ML projects use GitHub Actions and CML for MLOps.
- Understand the common MLOps practices and tools employed in GitHub projects.

## Tools:
- GitHub Actions
- CML (Command Line Tool for CI/CD in machine learning projects)
- DVC (Data Version Control)
- Docker
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- AWS
- Terraform

## Benefits:
- Identifying common practices can provide insights for the broader MLOps community.
- Using GitHub Actions and CML can streamline the ML development workflow.

## Metrics:
- Frequency of actions/tools used in GitHub workflows.
- Number of repositories containing specific workflows.

## Approaches:
- Manual inspection of repositories.
- Use of the Apriori algorithm to identify frequently co-occurring actions.
- Analysis of shell commands extracted from run attributes.

## Challenges:
- Lack of significant open-source ML projects on GitHub employing MLOps.
- The use of buzzwords like 'machine learning' and 'artificial intelligence' in projects without actual ML content.
- Many available repositories are primarily for test-driving purposes.

## How to implement responsible AI methods:
- [The paper doesn't seem to provide insights on this particular point]

## Reviewer's Comments:
The paper provides an initial look into the adoption and practices of MLOps on GitHub. It highlights the scarcity of genuine open-source ML projects on GitHub employing MLOps, which is surprising given the popularity of the platform. The research's limited focus on GitHub Actions and CML, while insightful, might have missed other MLOps tools, suggesting the need for a broader scope in future studies.
