## Tools:
- MLFlow
- Multi-Level DNN GPU Benchmark (mldgpu)

## Benefits:
- Reproducible benchmarking of deep learning model training.
- Efficient data collection and exploration for systematic experiments.
- Comparison of data within and between experiments through a unified interface.

## Metrics:
- Hardware metrics, including GPU utilization, memory usage, and power consumption.
- Software metrics related to model training performance.

## Approaches:
- Extending the MLFlow platform to meet data management and visualization requirements.
- Supporting multiple machine learning environments, including anaconda environments and docker containers.
- Allowing collocation of multiple models on GPUs using technologies like MIG and MPS.
- Incorporating listeners for hardware metric collection.

## Challenges:
- Efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets.
- Managing and visualizing gigabytes of numeric data.
- Balancing hardware utilization and resource consumption.
- Supporting various machine learning environments and deep learning libraries.

## How to implement responsible AI methods:
The paper primarily focuses on data management and benchmarking in deep learning training systems. While it doesn't explicitly address responsible AI methods, responsible AI can be integrated into the framework by considering ethical and fairness aspects during the experiment design and dataset selection phases.

## Reviewer's Comments:
