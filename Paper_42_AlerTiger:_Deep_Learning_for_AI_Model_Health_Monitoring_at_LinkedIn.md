## Abstract/Introduction Summary:
The paper introduces AlerTiger, a deep-learning-based MLOps model monitoring system. This system aids AI teams across organizations in monitoring the health of their AI models by detecting anomalies in model inputs and outputs over time. It provides holistic reports for actionable alerts, exhibits high precision and recall in detecting anomalies, and operates with quick execution times.

## Motivation:
- The need to monitor AI models’ health by detecting anomalies in their input features and output scores over time.
- Achieving high precision and recall in detecting anomalies without long execution times.
  
## Tools:
- AlerTiger (Main tool discussed in the paper)
- ProML platform (used at LinkedIn)
- Other benchmarking tools: Prophet, ARIMA, AR, DeepAR, and SARIMAX

## Benefits:
- Provides three categories of statistics to indicate AI model health.
- Offers a two-stage deep anomaly detection solution to address label sparsity and ensure the generalizability of monitoring new models.
- Generates holistic reports for actionable alerts.
- Implementation across most of LinkedIn’s production AI models for over a year, resulting in numerous improvements to AI models.

## Metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Execution Time

## Approaches:
- Use of deep learning for anomaly detection.
- Anomaly detection on all features for a model and monitoring feature-level mean and feature-level coverage statistics.

## A 400 word pitch for the paper:
The paper, "AlerTiger: Deep Learning for AI Model Health Monitoring at LinkedIn", introduces an avant-garde solution for AI model health monitoring using deep learning. This solution, AlerTiger, is not just a tool, but a beacon for AI teams aiming to seamlessly monitor their AI models' health. Developed and matured in the vibrant tech ecosystem of LinkedIn, this solution addresses the crucial challenge of detecting anomalies in AI models' inputs and outputs in real-time.

One of the quintessential problems AI teams grapple with is achieving both high precision and recall in detecting anomalies without being bogged down by long execution times. AlerTiger, in this realm, stands out prominently. Not only does it provide actionable, holistic reports for detected anomalies, but it also ensures that these alerts are both swift and accurate. This accuracy is underlined by the system's performance, which has been tested rigorously against other renowned tools like Prophet, ARIMA, and DeepAR.

Another unique facet of AlerTiger is its two-stage deep anomaly detection solution. It's been architected to address the real-world challenge of label sparsity and to ensure that new models can be monitored with the same generalizability as existing ones. AlerTiger is not just a tool but a comprehensive system. It integrates anomaly filtering mechanisms, basing them on multiple parameters like severity, duration, and even model traffic ratio. Such granularity ensures that AI teams receive alerts that truly matter, mitigating the risk of "alert fatigue".

Success is best validated by real-world application, and AlerTiger's deployment on LinkedIn’s ProML platform stands testament to its efficacy. Within a year of its implementation, the system has identified and rectified numerous model issues, leading to substantial business gains.

In conclusion, AlerTiger is a testament to the potential of deep learning in the MLOps space. Its precision, speed, and adaptability make it a must-consider solution for AI teams worldwide. As the realm of AI continues to expand, tools like AlerTiger will be pivotal in ensuring that our AI models not only function optimally but also evolve adaptively.
