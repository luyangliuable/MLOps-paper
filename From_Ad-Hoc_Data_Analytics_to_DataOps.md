## Reviewer's Comments:
While the paper offers a comprehensive understanding of DataOps and its evolution, its direct relevance to MLOps is limited. However, the overlapping principles like CI/CD, pipeline automation, and agile methodologies can offer valuable insights for MLOps enthusiasts. Future studies can explore the intersection of DataOps and MLOps, especially in the context of machine learning model lifecycle.
